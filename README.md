# Chess

This was a challenge to see if I can create a Chess game using P5.js and have it connected to Firebase to set up matches.

Using p5 ended up being a mistake because due to lag the project came to a close. I later rewrote the chess part of it in JavaFX to see a completed game.


Completed:
- Pieces were completely functional.
- Selection and movement of pieces.
- Killed pieces shown on the side.
- Creating an account that is connected to Firebase.
- A self-made UI framework built on p5.

Mistakes:
- Clicking on pieces was handled by color shading as opposed to an actual grid system. This would sometimes completely break movement. (Fixed in JavaFX version)

Incomplete:
- Realtime Chess matches.
